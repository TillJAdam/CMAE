## Instructions for use
Note that since this repository is for code peer review, the .xlsx files are ***simulations*** of the data from the SATIETY study, not the original data.
Hence, the ***results will not match*** the results in the submitted manuscript.
To replicate this study, similar longitudinal data would have to be collected, and the code would be able to run on it.
